# Sample Programs

## Login

A Company needs a simple login interface.

Write a program that takes in a username and password. The program should then test to see if the password is correct. If it is then the user should be welcomed by the interface.

> The correct password is `PA55W()rd`.





## Journey times

A delivery driver wants a simple program to help him calculate the time it will take him to make various journeys. The program should prompt him to input the starting place and destination of a journey, the distance he will have to travel, and his estimated average speed. The program will use the formula: 
 
> speed = distance / time
 
to calculate the journey time. 
 
The program should display the start, destination, distance, average speed and time (to one decimal place where appropriate). 
 




## Water Tank Volume 
 
Write a program to calculate the volume of a cylindrical water tank, using the formula:  
 
> volume = π r2 h (r = radius of tank, h = height of tank) 





## Football Points 
 
Design, write and test a program to calculate the number of points gained by a football team, given the number of wins, draws and lost games, assuming a win is worth 3 points, a draw 1 point, and no points for a lost game 





## Graphic File Size 
 
Design, write and test a program to calculate the storage requirements in megabytes for bitmapped graphics.  
 
The inputs should be the breadth and height of the graphic in inches, the resolution in pixels per inch and the colour depth in bits per pixel. 





## Password Generator 
 
A program is required which will automatically generate a password from information provided by the user.  
 
The program should generate the password from the first letter of their first name, second letter of their surname, last two digits of their year of birth, second and third letters of their favourite colour, first three letters of their street name, their shoe size, and the letters VB. 
 
> For example: 
- Brenda McSporran 
- Born in 1987 
- Likes the colour green 
- Lives in Market Place 
- Wears size 38 shoes  
so her password will be Bc87reMar38VB





## ATM 
 
When you try to take money out of an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine, commonly called a cashdispenser or ‘hole in the wall’). You are only allowed to withdraw cash up to your credit limit. For example, if your credit limit is £100, and you try to withdraw £50, then it should work fine. However, if you try to withdraw £150, you will not be allowed to, and a message will appear on the screen advising you that this is over your credit limit.

**Extra task**
 
Modify the ATM program so that it asks your age, and gives you the message ‘You are too young to drive’ or ‘You can learn to drive’ as appropriate. 





## Prize Winner 

A program is required that will select a suitable prize, depending on which number between 1 and 5 is entered by the user. 
 
1. Wins a colour TV 
2. Wins a mobile phone 
3. Holiday in Bermuda 
4. Wins 20p 
5. Trip to DisneyLand 
 
**Extra task**
 
Randomly generate a number between 1 and 5 and tell the user which prize that have won 
 




## Grader 
 
A program is required that could be used to assign grades to test marks automatically. Over 80% is an A+, over 70% is an A, over 60% is a B, over 50% is a C, over 45% is a D, and less than 45% is a fail.  
 
The program should work for any test, whatever the maximum score. It should display a ‘certificate’ on screen, showing the student’s name (in the form ‘A. Einstein’), the possible mark, student’s mark, percentage and grade. 
 
**Extra task**
 
Save the grades to a text file 




 
## Postage Calculator 
 
Design, implement and test a program to calculate the cost of posting a package by first class mail, based on the following table: 
 
| Weight up       | to Cost |
| --------------- | ------- |
| 60g             | 28p     |
| 100g            | 42p     |
| 150g            | 60p     |
| 200g            | 75p     |
| 250g            | 88p     |
| 300g            | £1.01   |
| 350g            | £1.15   |
| 400g            | £1.33   |
| 450g            | £1.50   |
| 500g            | £1.68   |
| 600g            | £2.03   |
| 700g            | £2.38   |
| 750g            | £2.55   |
| 800g            | £2.73   |
| 900g            | £3.10   |
| 1000g           | £3.45   |
| each extra 250g | add 86p |





## Using FOR loops 
 
Write a program that uses a For... Next loop to produce each of the following lists of numbers: 
 
1. 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 ……… 33, 36 
2. 0, 9, 18, 27 …… 99 
3. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 
4. 0, 0.75, 1.5, 2.25, 3, 3.75, 4.5 
5. 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0, -10, -20, -30, -40, -50 
6. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 (hint: these are all numbers squared) 
7. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 (hint: these are powers of 2) 





## Times Table

A primary school teacher wants a program which will allow a pupil to type in any whole number. The program will then display the relevant times table, up to a maximum multiplier set by the pupil. The display should be in the format:

5 times 1 equals 5

5 times 2 equals 10

5 times 3 equals 15, and so on … 





## Cubic Numbers 
 
A mathematician wants a list of cubic numbers (1, 8, 27, 64, 125 ….) starting and finishing at any point on the list. The results should be displayed like this:

2 cubed = 8

3 cubed = 27

4 cubed = 64, and so on…. 





## Cost and Weight Calculator 
 
A greengrocer needs a program which will allow him to type in the price of 1kg of any item. The program should then display the cost of 0, 0.1, 0.2… up to 1.8, 1.9, 2.0 kg of the item. The output might look something like this: 
0 kg costs £0

0.1 kg costs £0.20

0.2 kg costs £0.40

0.3 kg costs £0.60, and so on … 





## Quadratic function Calculator 
 
A pupil has been asked to draw a graph of the function y = 3x2 + 4. 

She needs a table of the values of the function between –5 and +5. 
 
She is not sure about the step size between points, so wants the program to allow her to choose any step size. 
 
The results should be displayed like this:

x = 1 >>>>>>>> y = 7

x = 2 >>>>>>>> y = 16

x = 3 >>>>>>>> y = 31 and so on… 





## Rolling die 

Write a program that simulates rolling a die by generating a random number between 1 and 6. After 100 “throws”, display a tally chart showing how many 1’s, 2’s, 3’s, 4’s, 5’s and 6’s were thrown. 
 
Modify your program so that it produces a double dice roll, and displays the number on each dice and the total score.  





## Grade Analyser 

Design, write and test a program for a teacher. The program should prompt the user to enter any list of names, which will be displayed on the screen. The program should count how many of these names begin with the letter A, and display this information at the end of the list. 
 
Adapt this so that the data can be read in from a CSV file or save entered data to a CSV file.  





## Password protection 

Design, write and test a program for a bank cash machine. The program should prompt the user to enter their PIN. If the PIN is correct, it should display ‘Welcome to the KPY Bank’. If not, it should notify the user that their PIN was entered wrongly, and let them try again, but only allow 3 tries. 
 
If the user enters their PIN wrongly 3 times, they should be warned that their card is being kept. 
 
**Extra task**
 
Modify the program to: 
- prompt the user to enter a password (which could contain letters as well as numbers) 
- allow 5 attempts at guessing the password 





## Log in 
 
Create a CSV file that contains a list of user names and passwords, e.g.

FBLOGGS,12345

BJONES,Password

KYOUNG,IA4ELT%!

MWELCH,ICTISBEST 
 
Then write a program that asks for the user to enter a username and password. If their username and password appears in the password CVS file, then display a suitable “logged in” message. Otherwise, display a suitable message and give them up to 2 more attempts.
