## 1-1-Fundamental-Concepts

### 1-1-1-Sequence

The principle of sequence is the idea that any numbered line cannot be processed before any previous line. Unless a line before executes a command that forces this.

Within C, commands are not separated by lines. They are instead separated by either:
```cs
; {}
```
The former semicolon is used to specify the end of a command or process. It is also used to declare a [variable](#1-1-2-assignment) and instanciate an object.
```cs
var example = "Hello World";
Console.WriteLine(example);
```
The latter curled braces are used to specify a block of code that is effected by either [selection](#1-1-3-selection) or [iteration](#1-1-4-iteration).
```cs
Do
{
    Console.WriteLine("I am inside the loop");
} While (true);
Console.WriteLine("I am outside the loop");
```



The principle of sequence can be overridden and ignored if necessary by the 
```cs
GoTo
```
command.

This can either move to a specified line number, or label (identifier followed by a comma)
```cs
exampleLabel:
    Console.WriteLine("TestCode");
```

The *break;* keywork can also be used to override sequence in that it breaks from a loop or enclosed statement within *`{}`*
```cs
Do
{
    break;
    Console.WriteLine("This will never execute");
}
Console.WriteLine("This will execute");
```


### 1-1-2-Assignment

#### 1-1-2-1-The-Basics-Of-Variables

Assignment is the concept of creating a temporary storage within ram to store data during the execution of the program.

A variable has 3 main components:

- identifier
- type
- data

The identifier is the name of the variable. In the below example it is the word *text*;
```cs
string text = "Hello World";
```
The identifier is used whenever you wish to reference the variable. To enter new data, or retrieve the data stored within the variable

To enter new data, use a single `=` operator
```cs
text = "This is being stored in the variable";
```
To access the data stored within the variable, enter the identifier in the location you wish to use the data
```cs
Console.WriteLine(text);
/// will be the same as
Console.WriteLine("This is being stored in the variable");
```
> Note: The identifier must be a whole word and cannot be the same as an existing command word or data type. There are 2 conventions for using identifiers with multiple words.
> 1. CamelCase. Where each word begins with a Capital Letter (this is recommended by Microsoft and is the convention within C#)
> 2. underscore. Where spaces are represented as `_` characters

The type refers to the type of data stored in the variable. The types can be viewed by clicking [here](#1-1-2-2-data-types). Within the above example, the type is the term *string*;

The data is the actual information that is stored within the variable. While it is not necessary to declare data upon creating the variable, it is highly recommended in order to avoid errors;

#### 1-1-2-2-Data-types

A data type refers to the type of data stored in the variable. There are 5 universally recognised strong data types. These are basic types that are available in every programming language

- [Integer](#1-1-2-2-1-integer)
- [Real](#1-1-2-2-2-real)
- [Boolean](#1-1-2-2-3-boolean)
- [Char](#1-1-2-2-4-char)
- [String](#1-1-2-2-5-string)

##### 1-1-2-2-1-Integer

An integer is a whole number either positive or negative. Most programming languages implement Integers as an INT32. This means that 32 bits or 8 bytes are assigned to the variable to store the number. Giving a possible range of `-2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647`.
An integer can be either signed or unsigned. A signed integer can be either positive or negative, while unsigned integers can only be positive

> Note: Within programming, 0 is considered both positive and even. This means that 0 is the lowest unsigned number you can have.

Within C#, an integer is declared using 
```cs
int variableName = 0;
```
An unsigned integer is declared using
```cs
uint variableName = 0;
```
if you wish to assign less or more bits to a number (either 16 or 64) then you can use
```cs
short smallerNumber = 0;
long longerNumber = 0;
```
The above rule with `u` for unsigned applies to these as well
```cs
ushort unsignedSmallerNumber = 0;
ulong unsignedLongerNumber = 0;
```

##### 1-1-2-2-2-Real

A real is a fractional number either positive or negative. There are multiple different formats available for this. While the double is less precise, it is faster to access. The opposite is true for floats.
```cs
double lessPreciseDecimal = 0.5;
float morePreciseDecimal = 0.5f;
```
> Note: float numbers should be defined with an *f* after the number to specify that it is floating point decimal rather than integer or fixed point decimal.

##### 1-1-2-2-3-Boolean

A boolean is a simple true or false. This can also be written as 1 or 0;
> Within C#, boolean actually has 3 possible forms of data: true, false or null;
```cs
bool variableName = true;
bool variableName = false;
```

##### 1-1-2-2-4-Char

A Char is a single character. This includes every letter, number and symbol. Every programming language will give support for all Extended-ASCII characters, and most give support for UCF-8 characters as well. This means you can use characters with accents or characters from other alphabets inside a char datatype.

> `""` is known as an empty char, it is a get out to avoid a null char as it technically counts as data.

```cs
char variableName = "a";
char variableName = "A";
char variableName = " ";
char variableName = "3";
char variableName = "";
char variableName = ";";
```

##### 1-1-2-2-5-String

A string is nothing more than an [array]() of [chars](#1-1-2-2-4-char)

```cs
string variableName = "word";
string variableName = "Multiple words. 2 to be Precise.";
```

### 1-1-3-Selection

#### 1-1-3-1-Structures

Selection is the process of running different blocks of code based on a boolean condition. Where 1 block of code is run on true, while the other is run on false.
```cs
if (value == true)
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will run if value is true");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will run if value is false");
}
/// because the if statement simply reads the boolean value, the above could be shortened to
if (value)
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will run if value is true");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will run if value is false");
}
```
an if statement can have multiple blocks based on a condition using else if
```cs
if (value == 1)
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will run if value 1");
}
else if (value == 2)
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will run if value is 2");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will run if value is any other value");
}
```
> Note: selection statements still follow the principle of [sequence](#1-1-1-sequence). Meaning that else if statments must superscede an else statement as else statements are all encompasing

In the event of a large amount of testable conditions it can be preferable to employ a select-case statement rather than an if statement.
```cs
switch (value)
{
    case == 1:
        Console.WriteLine("This will run if value 1");
        break;
    case == 2:
        Console.WriteLine("This will run if value is 2");
        break;
    case else:
        Console.WriteLine("This will run if value is any other value");
        break;
}
```

It is possible to next selection operations so that an if statement is within another if statement or a case statement
```cs
if (value == 1)
{
    if (value2 == 1)
    {
        Console.Writeline("This will run if both value 1 and value 2 are 1");
    }
}
```

#### 1-1-3-2-Operators

there are 6 main operators which can be used to compare values and return a boolean based on the result of the comparison:

- == - returns true if both values are the **same** value and type
- &lt;  - returns true if the first value is **less** than the second value
- &lt;= - returns true if the first value is **less** than or equal to the second value
- &gt;  - returns true if the first value is **more** than the second value
- &gt;= - returns true if the first value is **more** than or equal to the second value
- != - returns true if both values are **not** the **same** value and type

### 1-1-4-Iteration

Iteration is the process of looping over and repeating a block of code for either an established or un-established number of times.
Loops are split into 2 types conditional or unconditional

#### 1-1-4-1-Unconditional-Loops

Unconditional loops will repeat for a pre-established number of times. This takes the form of a for loop
The for loop is split into 3 parts:
- initialiser
- condition
- iterator

The initialiser creates a new variable to store the current loop counts
The condition checks whether the loop has iterated the required number of times
The iterator increments the loop count when it loops
```cs
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine("This will be executed 5 times");
}
```
The iterator variable can be accessed by the code within the loop
```cs
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

#### 1-1-4-2-Conditional-Loops

Conditional loops will repeat until a condition is true. This can therefore theoretically loop infinitely.

There are 2 types of Conditional Loop. Test Before and Test after

##### 1-1-4-2-1-While-Loops

A While loop, also known as a Test Before loop will check a condition before executing the iteration. Meaning the code will run 0 or more times
```cs
While (Condition == true)
{
    Console.WriteLine("This value will display while condition is true");
}
```

##### 1-1-4-2-2-Do-Loops

A Do loop, also known as a test after loop will check a condition after executing the iteration. Meaning the code will run 1 or more times
```cs
Do
{
    Console.WriteLine("This value will display while condition is true");
} While (Condition == true);
```
