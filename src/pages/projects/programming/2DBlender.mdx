This program took 9 months to complete and was submitted as my A-Level Coursework. It is build in VB.net using the winforms system for interface. Outside of this it is based on the priniciple of Object-Oriented Programming represented in a graph data structure by separating vector shapes to vertices (nodes), edges (arcs) and faces (fills). Nodes stored a location while arcs and fills store colour. All of these are able to store this information either globally or temporally (as a keyframe) to enable animation.
