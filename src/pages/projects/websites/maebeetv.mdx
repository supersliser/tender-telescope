MaebeeTV is one of the studios of which I am a part of. In my capacity as head of IT, I am tasked with managing, maintaining and upgrading the official website of the company. It is built within the javascript framework 'Astro' and is designed to function as a basis for the companies advertising as well as a portfolio of the various projects that the studio has created.
