While the original spiderman model is not homemade, the cape and environment are. The entire scene is designed to implement a horror-esque effect. The cloak is modelled using Blender's physics engine and the spiderman model is animated using Cascadeur. The song is a cover of Paint it Black from the rolling stones.
