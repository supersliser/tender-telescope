This slime texture takes advantage of the nature of 4 dimensions. Imagine a 3 Dimensional cube if you will, when you travel up one axis, the other 2 axis get smaller as you get further away from their origin. However, this is not a snapping sort of motion, rather it is a continual shrinking movement. This mode of movement is useful however the direction is wrong.

No matter which axis we travel across, the other 2 axis will get smaller in a 3 dimensional shape. What we need is a 4th axis, one that can manipulate our perspective of the other 3. This is where the concept of a 4D object comes in. This continual movement without the shrinking of individual axis creates a flowing-like movement. This concept can then be applied to a model to give it a fluid texture.
