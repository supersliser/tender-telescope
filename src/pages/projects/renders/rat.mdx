The final stage of modelling is character generation. The ability to build the anatomical and visible structure of a character is considered one of the most difficult and also most important stages of learning 3D modelling. Mostly due to the fact that this requires an in-depth knowledge and analysis of the structure of these characters, they then must rig these in such a way that the built mesh can be reformed in such a way that it appears natural. These require much more careful effort.


Shaders were also a careful consideration as these are intended to be more blunt in terms of shading. Meaning that there is less of a gradient between colours and rather static changes. This presents a feel of being hand drawn which allows this work to feel more in line with the concept of a cartoon style.
