This forest is built entirely procedually - in terms of both model and texture. It is built within the procedural system brought in by Blender 3 (this specifically was build in version 3.1)

## Grass

<div>

Starting with the grass, this is generated by building a single blade of grass from a bezier curve with a gradient at the top and bottom to create the idea of the grass getting thinner and thicker based on the location on the blade. Each blade is then pulled into a clump of 5 blades, all of which are then placed onto the ground model through 2 procedural maps, a noise texture to place it randomly, and a musgrave texture to invent a sense of 'patchyness', allowing it to more accurately simulate real grass.

## Trees

<div>

<img src={trees} alt="an image displaying a close up on the trees from the bottom so that the design of the texture can be seen more clearly" />

The trees then are generated with a similar idea in mind as the grass, just much thicker. And the initial branches in a similar method as well just without the musgrave patchyness and the noise rapped around the trunk rather than the ground. However, the branches after that are generated differently. They use a system of recursion where they continue to place instances of themselves however everytime an instance of itself is created, the chance of the next instance being a leaf rather than a branch increases until up to around 6 instance levels where it is guarenteed that all branches are leaves. This pseudo-randomness further pushes the element of photorealism by simulating the logic of real trees.

</div>

## Water

<div>

The water is the final component of this stage. It is generated using a second musgrave texture which determines plots to lower the ground, underneath the ground layer is a 4 dimensionally textured (for the effect of flowing water) block of water that is only visible when the map lowers the ground to below that level.

I believe this creation to be my finest piece of work and best to accurately display my abilities as a 3D student. This is due to the fact that it accurately demonstrates what can be achieved by merging 3D art, the mathematics of modelling, observed natural logic and computational concepts such as recursion.
