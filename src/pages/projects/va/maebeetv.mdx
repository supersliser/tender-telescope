MaebeeTV is one of the studios of which I am a part of. One of my roles is head of Voice Acting. This role requires me to manage the various voice actors within the company and suggest which ones should take which roles. I also fulfill some of the various roles myself thanks to my naturally deep voice.

The audio featured in here is for a series named MaebeeTV kids which holds miniture story times for children.
